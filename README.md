# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

We used Machine learning techniques to evaluate past data pertaining to the stock market and world affairs of the corresponding time period, in order to make predictions in stock trends. We built a model that will be able to buy and sell stock based on profitable prediction, without any human interactions. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make smart “decisions” based on current affairs, article, etc. With NLP and the basic rule of probability, our goal is to increases the accuracy of the stock predictions.

We have used the Combined_News_DJIA.csv dataset (courtesy Aaron7sun, Kaggle.com) .The Combined_News_DJIA.csv dataset spans from 2008 to 2016. We extended the dataset to include additional data. This additional data is collected from the Guardian’s Restful News API for the 2000- 2008 period. We take the 25 most popular headlines for each given day in this period. In addition, we also pull the Dow Jones Index (DJI) of Yahoo Finance’s website for the 2000- 2008 period to compare the influence of the data.
